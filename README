WWW::SimpleRobot
================

Description
-----------

A simple perl module for doing robot stuff. For a more elaborate interface,
see WWW::Robot. This version uses LWP::Simple to grab pages, and
HTML::LinkExtor to extract the links from them. Only href attributes of
anchor tags are extracted. Extracted links are checked against the
FOLLOW_REGEX regex to see if they should be followed. A HEAD request is
made to these links, to check that they are 'text/html' type pages.
